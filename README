This git repo contains scripts for backing up various wadges of data from the
SR server into some kind of manipulatable form.

Note that it doesn't back it up into the same format as in the server secrets
git repo. This is because the server secrets goo is for configuring things,
not for actually storing our data.

There are also no scripts for restoring; this is because restoring isn't a
frequent use case (nor should it ever be).

== Encrypting ==

There is the option of encrypting the output of the backup. The intention being
that backing up of data can be done by cron on a remote machine under someones
user account, without us having to worry about additional access controls.

To do this, specify the -e switch. Currently the backup script will instruct gpg
to use the identity backups@studentrobotics.org. This needs to be a public key
installed to root's keyring and _signed_ by root as well. These steps shouldn't
ever make their way into automated configuration, given how ludicrously
important posession of the backup secret key is.
