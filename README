This git repo contains scripts for backing up various wadges of data from the
SR server into some kind of manipulatable form.

Note that it doesn't back it up into the same format as in the server secrets
git repo. This is because the server secrets goo is for configuring things,
not for actually storing our data.

There are also no scripts for restoring; this is because restoring isn't a
frequent use case (nor should it ever be).
